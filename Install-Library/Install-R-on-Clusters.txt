Take TACC as a example. I want to install R packages on TACC is because I want to use standalone Rmath library.

Here are the links which can provide detailed installation guidance:
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/343452/how-to-install-r-3-3-1-in-my-own-directory
https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s243/rmath.html
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#The-standalone-Rmath-library

Download tar files of R, zlib, bzip2, xz, pcre and curl.

Unzip by tar -xf Tar-File-Names.

Firstly install them except R following the three steps:
1. ./configure prefix=local/path
2. make
3. make install

export CPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Install R by command:
./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/work/03461/lh26/lonestar/bzip2-1.0.6/include -I/work/03461/lh26/lonestar/xz-5.2.2/usr/local/include -I/work/03461/lh26/lonestar/pcre-8.39 -I/work/03461/lh26/lonestar/curl-7.57.0/include" LDFLAGS="-L/work/03461/lh26/lonestar/bzip2-1.0.6/lib -L/work/03461/lh26/lonestar/xz-5.2.2/usr/local/lib -L/work/03461/lh26/lonestar/pcre-8.39 -L/work/03461/lh26/lonestar/curl-7.57.0/lib" prefix=/work/03461/lh26/lonestar/R-patched

Then go to src/nmath/standalone and 
make

Done!
